title: Link helpers
---

markdown:
  In addition to the components, this gem also comes with link helpers that are
  often reimplemented across projects.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Regular link",
  code: govuk_link_to_normal) do

  p.govuk-body

  markdown:
    Regular links are just plain [anchor elements][0]
    with the `govuk-link` class.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Inverse hyperlink",
  code: govuk_link_to_inverse,
  inverse: true) do

  p.govuk-body
    | Use inverse hyperlinks on dark backgrounds.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Other link styles",
  code: govuk_link_other_styles)

hr.govuk-section-break.govuk-section-break--xl.govuk-section-break--visible

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Class helpers",
  code: govuk_link_classes_multiple) do

  p.govuk-body
    markdown:
      Rails has [lots of link helpers][0]
      and only the most frequently used are wrapped by this library. If you need
      to use another variant, like `link_to_if`, you can use the
      `govuk_link_classes` and `govuk_button_classes`
      helpers to ensure the correct classes are assigned.

      When no arguments are provided to `govuk_link_classes`, only
      the default `govuk-link` will be added. Alternate styles
      can be passed in as a snake cased array of variants.
